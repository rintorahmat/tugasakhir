It's hard to do edits fof social media due to the lag cuz it will make your timing off also not many useful effects it's better to just do little cheats to make your own. It also offton won't let you play your videos and stuff to the point you have to uninstall and reinstall and start the edit all over,2,0,7.6.0,3/13/2023 20:43,,,7.6.0,most_relevant,com.lemon.lvoverseas
